      <p>Melissa Callow is a Brisbane based cabin crew member who has been with the company since 2002...<br/>Her bubbly positive attitude has made her one of the most popular crew members in our port. Whilst in Hobart in 2003, on a tour of duty, Mel received some devastating news regarding her fiancé Sean. This news would ultimately change her life forever;</p>
      <p>Mel was told that Sean had gone for a swim, caught a wave and collided with a sandbank. Sean had broken his neck in three places. Subsequently Sean is now a quadreplegic. Since then Sean has worked tirelessly every day doing extensive physio. He will never give up on his goal of one day walking again, and ultimately, gaining employment. Incredibly, through sheer determination and strength of character, Sean has regained some use of his hands and arms.</p>
      <p class="highlight">A ‘wheelchair-bound user’ vehicle complete with hand controls <br />and access ramps costs $50,000.</p>

    <p>In April 2015, myself and 6 other cabin crew members will be flying at our own expense, to England. We will undertake the famous 'Coast to Coast Walk' - trekking for 15 days across the entire width of England. Picking a pebble out of the Irish Sea, we will be traversing the rugged Lake District and Yorkshire Moors, culminating at Robin Hoods Bay on the East coast, where we will ceremoniously throw our pebbles in to the North Sea.</p>

    <p>I am sure most of you would have met one of us in your time with the company. We are dedicating this walk to Sean and Mel, and with your help, and the rest of our colleagues, we hope to raise $50,000 to purchase a hand controlled modified vehicle to give Sean a modicum of freedom and also a chance of future employment.</p>
